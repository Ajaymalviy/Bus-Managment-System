  <h1>  1- Real-Time Omnichannel Sales Management  </h1>
<p>Lets be honest. Passenger transport is a low margin business, which is why it is imperative for a successful operator not to miss out on any potential customer.

Thus, its  critical that you have a real-time overview of every available seat in as wide sales network as possible. Be it web-based OTAs or a bus driver who has reached a stop in the middle of and starts selling tickets to ad hoc clients.

Real-time seat and sales management is also a prerequisite to implementing demand-based yielded pricing, which for many operators has proven to be a key factor of success.

Note: Download our case study to see how demand-based yielded pricing works for a bus company</p>

<h1>2- Advanced Fare Management</h1>
<p> Pricing depends very much on what type of long-distance travel business you do. Our experience shows that mid to large bus companies, especially the leading ones in their regions, tend to diversify their operations between long-distance, international, shuttle and commuting services.

For such operators, it is crucial for their reservation system to offer corresponding specific fare models that meet their operational business requirements.

Be it yielded dynamic pricing in competitive intercity operations, or serial travel passes for commuter/shuttle services, a modern reservation system must be able to handle those scenarios for the operator to be able to provide holistic passenger experience across their operations.

To make it simple, lets name a few examples of modern fare management capabilities:

Demand and/or time until departure based pricing (yield management)
Group discounts (inc. mixed passenger segments like the family package, etc.)
Round trip discounts
Network pricing to offer competitive fares on interconnected journeys
Flexible fare rules (modifications, refunds, etc.)
Versatile, periodic, and serial ticket products </p>
<h1> 3- Advanced Inventory Management</h1>
<p> Seat inventory management is dependent on the operators specific business model. For example, shuttle services don’t usually need specific seat inventory management. Yet for intercity operations, real-time inventory management is a must.

Assuming the operator is able to harmonize and plan their fleet in advance, it would be highly desirable to offer passengers the option to choose their specific seat on all the stop segments without compromising the availability on other segments. This way operators can maximize their seat utilization and revenue per km.</p>

<h1> 4-Modern Digital Marketing Tools</h1>
<p> A reservation system is a source of valuable data that a bus operator can use for marketing (with consent, of course). Without proper digital marketing tools, a bus company doesnt exist for a modern passenger.

A long-distance bus company has to be present in most of the digital channels so that finding them will be as fast and easy as possible for the passenger of the future.

The marketing toolbox should at least include the tools for social media, campaigns, email marketing, loyalty schemes, etc. Tools that for example Flixbus is using successfully to attract millennials.

They are a characteristic of a well-made reservation system that a company can use to increase their ridership. We will go more in-depth on the digital marketing topic in an upcoming post on our blog.</p>

<h1> 5 - Self-Service Capability</h1>
<p> In most parts of the modern world, fewer employees equal higher cost efficiency. Thus, the more passengers can manage their travel-related aspects by themselves, the fewer employees operators need in their call-centre and support desks.

Additionally, moving towards self-service will increase customer satisfaction because they can manage their trip details whenever they want without having to deal with other people. It is a win-win situation.

Usability of self-service features needs special attention. They need to be simple, logical, and intuitive. Otherwise, it will only create confusion and in the worst case, increase the load on your support desk.

But self-service is not only related to digital sales channels. The same applies to brick-and-mortar locations. Ticket vending machines, for example, are a great way to reduce labour costs while maintaining a presence in important locations.</p>

<h1> 6- Multi-modal Interconnectivity</h1>
<p> It’s shouldn’t come as a surprise anymore that due to digital disruption in the passenger transport industry, multimodal concepts like MaaS will push intercity operators to think outside their own route network. Modern passengers expect their service provider to solve their whole journey needs.

On one hand, this requires operators to provide capabilities of their own inventory to be interconnected with other service providers in external multi-modal search engines.

Yet, for leading operators, it will also mean that they would need to be able to combine other external inventory within their own reservation system creating multi-leg and multi-ticket reservations that take into account flexible combination algorithms to provide reasonable and meaningful interconnections.</p>

<h1> 7- Business Analysis Capability</h1>
<p> We believe that as a bus reservation system developer, we shouldn’t put too much effort on building highly adjustable reporting tools within our platform.

Instead, we should focus on recording the data in a fragmented, well-structured and accessible format for using it in dedicated BI tools focused for that job.

As data handled by reservation systems in the travel industry is highly relative and multi-layered, there shouldn’t be any “hacks” and “quick-fix” solutions in the database structuring (“lets- use-this-comments-field”), resulting in clutter and in the worse case, wrong analysis results for decision-making.</p>
<!-- <h2> Thankyou Indore</h2>
<p>Indore, the largest metropolitan city of the state of Madhya Pradesh, is fast emerging as a centre of trade and commerce. In the context of rapid growth of the city, increasing mobility, high travel demand, increasing intensity of traffic, congestion, delays, accidents and other such problems, public mass transport system of the city stands out as the most critical issue. The intra-city public transport system is essentially road based with 500 private minibuses , 550 tempos and 10000 auto rickshaws. Since there was no specialized and effective regulatory agency to monitor the system a special purpose vehicle in the form of public limited company "Atal Indore City Transport Services Ltd." was set up to operate and manage the public transport system in Indore with private sector participation to overcome financial constraints.

    The aforesaid company has identified and took permission for 18 high travel demand routes from RTA and has already started operation of its 37 ultra-modern low floor buses. These city buses with 2 broad doors are allowing passengers to board and alight quickly and easily, save time and fuel, and give better run-times and improved economy to the bus operators. Real time vehicle tracking and fully computerized ticket vending system are some other highlights. O&M and other regulatory measures are being exercised by the company.
    
    The main sources of revenue for the system are the fair box collection, advertising, passes revenue and bidding amount by private participants. The optimum fare structure has been decided to meet twin objective of Equity access to poor and incentive for upper middle class to prefer these buses over their own vehicles. The fares have been kept reasonable to give healthy competition to existing minibuses and tempos, low enough to secure fullest utilization and high enough to ensure viability of the system within the government norms. System of monthly, weekly, employee and student passes will ensure the fullest utilisation of the new system.
    
    Financial evaluation of the project was carried out with the objective of determining its financial viability and assessing its potential for implementation on a commercial format. At this stage, projected financial analysis estimates the likely returns to the operators, company and people at la</p> -->
